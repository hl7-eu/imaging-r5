The DiagnosticReport has been designed in such a way that the relevant information can be easily found.

The table below shows the way the main content elements in a Radiology report are represented in this profile:

The notes section has an optional `annotation-type` extension. When present it indicates that the note applies to the section identified in the Coding included in the extension.

This profile has been aligned with the IHE-IDR profile which is still under development, parts where we deviate are:
* IDR places unstructured text in DiagnosticReport.text in this profile the `note` field is used. The section the `note` applies to is identified using the `annotation-type` extension.
