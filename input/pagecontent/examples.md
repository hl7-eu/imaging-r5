This section illustrates the way imaging reports can be created using these IG's. The following examples are included:

1. Imaging report with the minimal amount of structured data ([link](./example-unstructured.html))
2. An imaging report generated from HL7v2 messages (TBD)
3. An imaging report with structured and unstructured elements ([link](./example-semi-structured.html))
4. An imaging report exploring many of the structured data elements ([link](./example-structured.html))

Please note that these examples illustrate the way this IG can be used to create imaging reports. No claim or guarantee is made about the clinical validity of the choices.
