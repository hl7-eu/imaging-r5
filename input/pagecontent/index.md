    The development of this Implementation Guide version has been supported by the 
    <strong>Xt-EHR Joint Action</strong>.  
    Xt-EHR provided expertise, alignment with European health policy priorities, 
    and validation of specifications to enable consistency with EHDS requirements.

### Scope

This implementation guide specifies imaging study data in the **European** context, as defined in {{ehnImaging}} and refined by {{XtEhrImaging}}, as a FHIR model. It defines:
* The structure and contents of a FHIR imaging studies and reports.
* Different options for publishing and searching for such studies and reports.
* Discovery of available mechanisms to access the imaging data.

The specification is to be used in a variety of deployment models, which includes the EHDS use cases: exchange data within healthcare organizations, across nations/regions and cross border information exchange. In all of these use cases it is important that it is compatible with the existing ecosystem.

Current approaches within Europe use different approaches to information exchange:
* **Document based exchange**, the document is represented as a FHIR Document Bundle.
* **REST API based access to documents**, a {{Composition}} and {{DiagnosticReport}} for each document including instances of the referred resources
* **REST API based access to resources**, as the previous but the (important) resources are *harmonized*, meaning that all documents point to the same {{Patient}}, {{Organization}} and other resources.

The specification is being designed in such a way that it can be used in all of these deployment scenarios.

### Purpose

The goal of this Implementation Guide is to define an European standard for the Imaging Study Report to facilitate the harmonization among the national initiatives and prepare the ground for the European EHR eXchange Format (E-EHRxF).

The development of this implementation guide is promoted by HL7 Europe, but realized in collaboration with several other European and national organizations and projects. The aspiration of this guide is to be used as basis for European National Guides, the European EHRxF ,and - consequently - by MyHealth@EU for the EU cross-border services.
